# -Shortest-Remaining-Time-First-SRTF-algorithm
Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) is the enahnced version of Shortest Job Next (SJN) algorithm, where the processor is allocated to the job that is closest to completion.  This algorithm requires adavnced knowledge and concept of CPU. It is adventageous because short processes are handled very quickly.
Here SRTF is implemented using C++.

First, program promt user to enter number of processes.
For every process arrival time and burst time also should be entered.

At the end of execution, user is able to see for every process:
1. burst time
2. arrival-time
3. waiting time
4. turnaround-time
5. completion-time

At the end, avarage waiting time and avarage turnaround time are displayed.
